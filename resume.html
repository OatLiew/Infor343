        <p>
             Welcome to my portfolio!   I am a current senior in the University of Washington Electrical Engineering program, focusing on the embedded system. Here you will find artifacts that display my ability in technical writing, presentation, engineering and art skills. These artifacts were generated through at the classes that I took at Edmonds Community College and the University of Washington.

    		<strong>About Me</strong>
    		 About me

            Cultural diversity has always been a part of me. I have been living in many different countries, primary school in Thailand, 5 years in Singapore, a year in Beijing, China and about 4 years in the States. Through these relocation, I have developed an interest to filter and absorb the positive trends of cultures. This adaptability allows me to transition smoothly into different working environments. Through the years abroad, my experiences have molded my personal passion in the unique combination  of art, architecture and engineering.
